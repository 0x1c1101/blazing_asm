A simple and lightweight assembler library that supports the majority of significant instructions from the Intel x86-64 architecture. Mainly beneficial for shellcode development and runtime bytecode generation. Due to its design, it can generate the byte code quite fast while allowing you to generate and use random registers/immediates at runtime. All necessary operations are made and determined at compile time.
