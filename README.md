A simple and lightweight assembler library that supports the majority of significant instructions from the Intel x86-64 architecture. Mainly beneficial for shellcode development and runtime bytecode generation. Due to its design, it can produce the machine code quite fast while allowing you to generate and use random registers/immediates at runtime.

## Why not use AsmJit?

If you need to generate x86-64 machine code with minimal overhead and maximum control, `BlazingASM` is a powerful alternative to dynamic assemblers like AsmJit. Designed entirely for compile-time code generation, it emits raw, fixed-size machine instructions directly into static arrays, eliminating the need for runtime encoding or memory management. Its single-header design requires no dependencies, making it lightweight and easy to integrate ~ even in bare-metal or embedded environments. With predictable instruction layout, very little to zero runtime allocation, and clean, assembly-like syntax, it is particularly well-suited for shellcode generation, firmware, code mutation or any scenario where performance, binary size, and determinism matter.

That being said, `BlazingASM` is intentionally minimal and focused; it doesn’t aim to match AsmJit’s vast instruction coverage, runtime flexibility, or feature set. Instead, it trades breadth for simplicity and performance ~ making it a practical tool when you know exactly what code you need, and want it fast and small.

## Setting it up

All you need to do is download the `blazing_asm.hpp` header file, paste it into your project folder, and add this in your source code:

```cpp
#include "blazing_asm.hpp"

.
.
.

auto shellcode = basm::assemble_static (
  basm::MOV (basm::RAX, basm::RBX),
  basm::MOV (basm::RCX, basm::RDX)
);
```

Or you can define `basm` namespace for a simpler syntax:

```cpp
using namespace basm;

auto shellcode = assemble_static (
  MOV (RAX, RBX),
  MOV (RCX, RDX)
);
```
