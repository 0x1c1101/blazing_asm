A simple and lightweight assembler library that supports the majority of significant instructions from the Intel x86-64 architecture. Mainly beneficial for shellcode development. Due to its design, it can produce the machine code quite fast while allowing you to use random registers/immediates at runtime.

## Requirements

- C++20 or above
- STL is not required (Compatible with kernel driver projects)

## Why not use AsmJit?

If you need to generate x86-64 machine code with minimal overhead, `BlazingASM` is a powerful alternative to dynamic assemblers like AsmJit. Designed for compile-time code generation, it emits raw and fixed-size machine instructions directly into static arrays, eliminating the need for runtime encoding or memory management. Single C++ header makes it really easy to integrate ~ even in kernel or embedded system projects. With a predictable layout, it's able to construct instructions at compile-time while handling dynamic operands at runtime without overhead. Particularly useful in exploit development, low-level code mutation and obfuscation, penetration testing and any scenario where shellcode is involved.

That being said, `BlazingASM` is intentionally minimal and template focused. It doesnâ€™t aim to match AsmJitâ€™s vast instruction coverage, runtime flexibility, or feature set. Instead, it trades breadth for simplicity and performance ~ making it a practical tool when you know exactly what code you need, and want it fast and small.

There are two different approaches you can utilize:

#### Static Mode
For a better demonstration, below is a screenshot of the comparison between the code and the disassembly (with `assemble_static()`):

#### Dynamic Mode
If you wish to use the dynamic code generation, below is a screenshot of the comparison between the code and the decompilation on IDA (with `assemble()`):

## Setting it up

All you need to do is download the `blazing_asm.hpp` header file, paste it into your project folder, and write this into your source code:

```cpp
#include "blazing_asm.hpp"

.
.
.

auto shellcode = basm::assemble_static (
  basm::MOV (basm::RAX, basm::RBX),
  basm::MOV (basm::RCX, basm::RDX)
);
```

You can also use `basm` namespace within a scope for a simpler syntax:

```cpp
{
  using namespace basm;
  
  auto shellcode = assemble_static (
    MOV (RAX, RBX),
    MOV (RCX, RDX)
  );
}
```

## Usage

You can find the detailed explanation in the [Documentation Page](DOCUMENTATION.md).
